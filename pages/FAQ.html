                First, ask your healthcare professional if testing is right for
                you. If so and if approved by your doctor, your genetic testing
                kit will be sent to you by Priority Mail. Simply follow
                instructions on how to use the enclosed noninvasive Q-tip oral
                swab, then mail back your DNA specimen in the pre-paid package.

              <p>
                While testing is the most accurate way to determine your risk of
                hereditary cancer, if you have had cancer and/or cancer runs in
                your family, you need to get tested then you should make your
                healthcare professional aware of it.
              </p>
              <p>
                To decide if you might benefit from hereditary-cancer genetic
                testing, simply take the simple, 30-second Pathema GX Labs quiz.
                Based on the results, you can discuss your risk of cancer with
                your healthcare professional and ask for further evaluation.

                The results will be sent to your trusted healthcare professional
                within 2-3 weeks of the day your sample arrives at the lab.

                Pathema GX labs can, however, give you (along with your
                physician) access to the education portal, which will help you
                understand the results. In many cases, a genetic counselor is
                provided if ordered by your doctor.

              <p>
                Knowing your family history is an important first step, but
                testing can give you a more accurate picture of your risk for a
                hereditary cardiovascular disease. This helps you and your
                healthcare professional understand your risk so you can make the
                best choices for preventive care.

                While testing is the most accurate way to determine the risk of
                hereditary cardiovascular disease, only people who have heart
                disease in their family or their personal history need to be
                tested. If you have heart disease and/or it runs in your family,
                let your healthcare professional know.

                To determine if you could benefit from genetic testing for

                Most insurance carriers cover genetic-testing services for
                hereditary cardiovascular disease. Although each case is unique,
                the average patient pays little to nothing out of pocket.

                Testing for a hereditary cardiovascular disease will enable you
                and your doctor to inform other members of your family about
                their risk of inheriting heart disease. This information can

                PharmacogenomicsÂ is the study of how your genes affect your
                response to drugs. This relatively new field combines
                pharmacology (the science of drugs) and genomics (the study of
                genes and their functions) to develop effective, safe
                medications and doses that are tailored to your unique genetic
                makeup.
