              <h3>Hereditary Cancer Preventive Testing.</h3>
              <p>Over 1 million people in America are diagnosed with cancer each year. Genetic and hereditary factors contribute to 5% of these patients. </p>
              <p>PathemaGx’s Hereditary Cancer Preventive Screening helps enable early diagnosis of cancer, which is the key to treatment potentials and recovery. Survival rates are 3 times higher when cancer is detected through early diagnosis. </p>
              <p>  Using the most technologically advanced Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS), PathemaGx provides accurate identification of gene mutations. Because inherited gene mutations may increase the risk of developing cancer, this technology allows providers to be more proactive and diligent with their protocols leading up to possible diagnoses. </p>

              <h3>Pharmacogenomics</h3>
              <p>According to the FDA, close to 5 million Americans are treated by medical professionals each year for adverse drug reactions. These reactions make this the nation’s 4th leading cause of death.</p>
              <p>
                Your genetic makeup plays an important role in how rapidly or slowly your liver absorbs and uses your prescription medications. It also reveals whether or not the proper class and dosage of medication are being prescribed.
              </p>
              <p> 
                That’s why pharmacogenomic testing can guide physicians to the most effective, safest therapeutic treatment options available. Our comprehensive panel of tests includes medication classes for the cardiovascular system, psychiatry, and pain. Since genes never change, these results are valid for a patient’s lifetime.
              </p>
              <p> 
                As medical conditions develop over time, pharmacogenomic data will help providers develop future treatment options and regimens, thus empowering patients and promoting their health and wellness.

              <h3>Genetic Carrier Testing</h3>
              <p>
                As a first step in family planning, Prenatal Carrier Preventive Screening can help detect an increased risk of specific inherited disorders in babies. 
              </p>
              <p>
                For women of child bearing age as well as couples, data shows that everyone is estimated to have 3 to 5 genetic mutations.** That doesn’t mean that you personally will have disorders, only that your children have the risk. (NOTE: Not sure why the original text states “as well as couples.”)
              </p>
              <p>
                This screening is done either prior to conceiving or within the first trimester of pregnancy. Understanding testing options will help prepare you for future health and hereditary genetic predispositions. Moreover, these results will also be true for following generations.
              </p>
              <p>    
                At PathemaGx, we offer genetic-carrier testing for single disorders as well as comprehensive testing for multiple disorders.

              <p>
                DNA Genetic Testing can not only reveal a great deal about your heart’s health, it can also let you and your provider be proactive in developing a heart-medication response, effective diets, and a personalized care plan.
              </p>
              <p>
                Without this insight into your genetic makeup, it is much more challenging to determine the right treatment and preventive-care plans. Also, many people don’t even know they have an inherited form of heart disease.
              </p>
              <p>
                To improve cardiovascular diagnosis, prognosis, and care management, we urge you to take the first step by reviewing our requisition for a detailed list of genes tested.

                In the U.S., Bacteria Vaginitis occurs in an estimated 21.3 million women ages 14 through 49.***
              </p>
              <p>
                PathemaGx’s comprehensive Women’s Wellness and Detection (WWD), which includes STI and UTI tests, uses a single swab to detect microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi through their gene expression. This technique delivers higher sensitivity, accuracy and speed of determination compared to traditional culturing methods.
              </p>
              <p>
                Our comprehensive testing panels include Bacterial Vaginitis, Aerobic Vaginitis, Group B Streptococcus, Urogenital Candidiasis, and STIs.

                Urinary Tract Infections account for over 100,000 hospital visits each year – largely because of missed diagnoses and poor turnaround time in reporting.
              </p>

                PathemaGx uses today’s most advanced molecular diagnostic-testing methods to identify microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses and fungi. Genetic makeup and gene expression are used to accurately identify species much more rapidly than traditional culture testing.

                Respiratory infections can often be easily transferred between individuals. When not properly identified and treated, they can cause severe illness and even death. 
              </p>
              <p>
                PathemaGx uses advanced PCR technology to provide comprehensive detection of potential bacterial and viral infections through their gene expressions.

              <p>
                In contrast to traditional culture testing, genetic testing for bacteria and viruses yields results rapidly. Then, by knowing your genetic makeup, your provider can limit your antibiotic resistance by prescribing the proper medication. This also speeds the recovery process.
